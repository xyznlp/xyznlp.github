I am a researcher at DXM AI Lab. Previously, I obtained my masterâ€™s degree from Beijing Normal University in 2020. I was also an intern at Microsoft Research Asia, Microsoft Xiaoice, Tencent Wechat and 360 Search. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing (Question Answering, Machine Reading Comprehension, Semantic Parsing, Generation), Recommendation System (Sequential Recommendation, User Modeling), Information Retrieval and Multi-Modal (Vision & Language), etc.
