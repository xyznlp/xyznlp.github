I am a researcher at DXM AI Lab. Previously, I obtained my masterâ€™s degree from Beijing Normal University. I was also an intern at Microsoft Research Asia, Microsoft Xiaoice, Tencent Wechat and 360 Search. I am broadly interested in **Natural Language Processing** (Question Answering, Machine Reading Comprehension, Semantic Parsing, Generation), **Recommendation System** (Sequential Recommendation, User Modeling), **Information Retrieval** and **Multi-Modal** (Vision & Language), etc.
